# Sentiment_Analyzer
Analyzing sentiments like positive or negative based on reviews/ feedbacks

📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based sentiment analysis system that uses a deep learning LSTM model trained on the Amazon Reviews dataset. It allows users to type in any product review and instantly see whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

The solution combines natural language processing (NLP) and Flask web development, making it both an AI-powered tool and a user-friendly application.

🎯 Key Highlights

Built a custom-trained LSTM model on thousands of Amazon product reviews.

Achieved high accuracy (close to 90%) in predicting review sentiment.

Integrated the model into a Flask web app for real-time interaction.

Designed a simple, clean, and responsive UI for easy use.

Showcases skills in NLP, Deep Learning, and Web Deployment.

🖥️ How It Works

The user enters a product review (e.g., “The phone battery lasts all day!”).

The text is processed and passed through the LSTM sentiment model.

The model predicts the review’s sentiment as either Positive 😊 or Negative 😞.

The result is displayed instantly on the web interface.

📊 Example Predictions

“The camera quality is fantastic!” → Positive

“Stopped working after just one week.” → Negative

“Delivered on time and works as expected.” → Positive

“The material feels very cheap.” → Negative

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Deep Learning (LSTM, Keras/TensorFlow) – for sentiment prediction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – for text preprocessing & tokenization

Flask – for backend web framework

HTML/CSS – for frontend interface

🌍 Impact & Applications

Can be applied to e-commerce platforms for automatic review analysis.

Helps businesses understand customer satisfaction at scale.

Useful for brand monitoring, feedback analysis, and market research.
